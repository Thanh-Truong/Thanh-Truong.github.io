Everything should be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_sv) for the sake of simplicity and ease of uninstallation

## Install Homebrew

{% highlight shell %}
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
{% endhighlight %}

It is quite common to be confused between `brew` and `brew cask`. In the nut shell, `brew` installs command-line softwares while `brew cask`installs graphical applications and it deals with licencees.

## Install git with ssh

I find my old post about [Git and SSH](/posts/2018/04/configuration-git/) useful indeed

## Install iTerm2
{% highlight shell %}
brew cask install iterm2
{% endhighlight %}

Before heading to the next headline, there is some good words here

## Install Oh My Zsh
This [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) is a framework built to manage [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration. In its own world, Zsh is a nicely designed interactive shell that I love to use when I develop. There are some better alternatives but I haven't got time to try them out.

* First step is off course, install Zsh
{% highlight shell %}
brew install zsh
{% endhighlight %}

More instructions about how to install Zsh on different OS can be found [here] 
(https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)

* Invoke `zsh` for the first time will take you to the configuration menu where a shitload of options to be configured. The result should be a `.zshsrc` file
more ~/.zshrc
{% highlight shell %}
brew install zsh

# Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
HISTFILE=~/.histfile
HISTSIZE=1000
SAVEHIST=1000
setopt nomatch
unsetopt autocd beep
bindkey -e
# End of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
# The following lines were added by compinstall
zstyle :compinstall filename '/Users/thtru/.zshrc'

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
# End of lines added by compinstall
{% endhighlight %}

* Themes
Simply choose a theme you like for example
```
# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="pygmalion"
```
