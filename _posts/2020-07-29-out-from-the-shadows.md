I had been very actively on writing technical notes from 2009 on WordPress and then it had cooled down gradually until a complete stop in late 2017.

While being idle, I did not stop consuming blog posts and technical notes from other developers on Stackoverflow, dev.to, or Medium and in return I contributed zero of useful contents to the developer community, which I am sure several will find them helpful.

It is always the right time to do the “writing”, said I today while sitting on a park bench during a chit chat with my girls. They are learning to write and, as expected from these young kids, often find great excuses not to practice writing.

Or maybe, a similar excuse that I often make: playing a family guy role with errands to run 7 days a week and finding absolutely no time to jot down a few notes as a computer scientist.

Maybe it is the right time to pick up writing again after these years? Only time will tell but I will give it a shot and see where I land next.

- I’ll revive good posts from my WordPress blog, which are fundamental and applicable for today tech.

- I write as a mean to save notes to first help me, myself and hopefully someone else.
