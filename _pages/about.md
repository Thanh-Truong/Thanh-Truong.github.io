This is a software developer and a former database researcher whose passion is building data-intensive applications.

As a former researcher, I spent several years at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/), Sweden.

Professionally, I am working as Data Engineer (or Data Magician) at one of the biggest TV channels in Nordic, [TV4](https://tv4.se) Stockholm, Sweden.

I am not quite a methodical runner yet despite that I aim at running all year round with several weeks on a treadmill due to slipperyness during Sweden winter. My source of inspirations and tips are from [Sverige springer](https://www.sverigespringer.se/).

Recently, I have picked up on writing technical notes again. They are [here](/year-archive/). Among them, a few notes here were revived from my old Wordpress blog in between 2009 - 20016

If it was not enough to keep me busy! I am also a father of twin grils and married to a wonderful wife.  

I am best reached via email as Iâ€™m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
